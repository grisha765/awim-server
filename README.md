# AWiM

AWiM (Android Wireless Mic) is a tool that allows you to 
stream microphone from your Android device to a PC running a GNU/Linux 
distribution with Pipewire as a sound server over Wi-Fi.

This repository contains source code of the server part (i.e. running on your phone). For the source code of the client part visit https://github.com/rotlir/awim-client



This is my first Android app, so it's probably heavily bugged...

If you found some bug or have an idea for improvement, feel free to open an issue or contact me in Matrix: @rotlir:matrix.org
